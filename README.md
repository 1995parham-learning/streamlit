> When Nostradamus uses Streamlit

## Introduction

I am going to use [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to provide data over beautiful UI.
Using Streamlit you can provide data, cache, and even plots for your users easily to demonstrate your data and even your model.

## How to run?

```bash
streamlit config show

streamlit run main.py
```
